          intuitive
          interface,
          reliability, Microsoft Windows port and simple installation all contributed to its popularity within

        <p><strong>Netscape Navigator</strong> was inspired by the success of the Mosaic web browser, which was
          co-written by Marc
          Andreessen. An important innovation that Netscape introduced was the on-the-fly display of web pages,
          where
          text and graphics appeared on the screen as the web page downloaded.</p>

        <p> The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee. This is standards organization
          for the
          web, which has a set of guidelines for browsers to adhere certain to HTML and DOM specifications.
          Because
          it’s not a strict set of rules, they can be interpreted differently by different rendering engines.
          This is
          largely why you see discrepancies in browser experiences. Browsers can conform the specification while
          still
          abiding by their own rules, which can cause compatibility issues.</p>
        <p>As browser versions update, many will add in other areas or features not specified in the W3C. Whether
          this
          be for competitive advantage or just because of a grey area in the guidelines, it can create
          cross-browser
          issues for software teams.</p>
        <p>The rendering engine is responsible for interpreting and displaying content. Since the rendering
          engines of
          browsers are different, the content behaves different ways. Sometimes these differences are slight,
          while
          sometimes they’re major and can even make a web page unusable.</p>
        <p>For example, Safari uses WebKit. Meanwhile, Chrome and Opera are both using Blink. Firefox uses Gecko
          and IE
          are using Trident. This means that each of these browsers abide by their own rules when it comes to
          rendering
          and displaying a web page, which can be a huge pain for developers trying to create a consistent
          experience.</p>

        <p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> made its debut as Microsoft’s first web browser. It was a reworked
          version of Spyglass
          Mosaic, which Microsoft licensed from Spyglass Inc., like many other companies initiating browser
          development. It was first released as part of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later
          versions were available as free downloads, or in service packs, and included in the OEM service
          releases of
          Windows 95 and later versions of Windows.</p>

        <h2>First Browser War</h2>
        <p>A browser war is competition for dominance in the usage share of web browsers.
          The most popular web browser was Netscape Navigator and when Microsoft’s browser appeared, Navigator
          had a
          market share of around 85%.</p>
        <p>Although Windows users had to buy Internet Explorer 1.0 as part of the Windows 95 Plus! pack,
          subsequent
          versions were made available as a free download, while Netscape Navigator cost $49. In short, Microsoft
          was
          giving away Internet Explorer to gain market share — something no other company could afford to do at
          the
          time.</p>
        <p>Microsoft’s tactical superiority over the competition — it also made the most popular computer
          operating
          system in the world — also meant it could ‘persuade’ PC manufacturers to include Internet Explorer with
          their
          new models instead of Netscape Navigator. That meant almost every new PC had an Internet Explorer icon
          on the
          Desktop as soon as it was switched on — and that meant users didn’t have to worry about downloading
          anything
          else.</p>

          This

        <p>The first browser war ended with Internet Explorer having no remaining serious competition for its
          market
          share. This also brought an end to the rapid innovation in web browsers; until 2006 there was only one
          new

        <h2>Second Browser War</h2>
        <p>Netscape Navigator was still around by this point, but it was no longer a force to be reckoned with.
          However, its source code had long since been released as open source and Mozilla 1.0 was launched in
          2002.
          Over 90 percent of web users were with Internet Explorer by now, but since not everyone was happy with
          Internet Explorer, some started to switch to this alternative.</p>
        <p>Mozilla soon evolved into the Phoenix web browser, which was then renamed to Firebird and then, in
          2004,
          renamed again to Firefox. Since it was open source software, Mozilla (in all its forms) was free to
          download
          and use and a little-known commercial browser called Opera also became free around this time.</p>
        <p>By the time Microsoft released Internet Explorer 7 in 2006, it was playing catch up to features
          already
          found in the increasingly popular Firefox (as it was then known) and Opera, and uptake was slow. Google
          raised the
          bar still higher in 2008 with its super-fast Chrome browser and it quickly found favour, gaining a 3.6
          percent market share in little under a year.</p>
        <p>But it was Firefox that was winning fans the fastest. By 2009, one report reckoned that it was the
          most
          popular web browser worldwide, when compared to individual versions of other browsers. In other words,
          while
          Internet Explorer was still by far the most popular web browser, Microsoft appeared to be losing the
          war.</p>

        <h2>Third Browser War</h2>
        <p>On January 23, 2018 Google launched Chrome 64 and Mozilla released Firefox 58 in the span of a day.
          The
          competition between the browsers across different devices renewed, and was termed as the start of a new
          browser war. By this time Microsoft had shifted from Internet Explorer as its representative web
          browser to
          Microsoft Edge, first released in 2015 with Windows 10. However the new browser failed to capture much
          popularity as of 2018. As of December 2018, combining all types of devices using the internet, Google
          Chrome
          remains the most used browser across the world by a wide margin.</p>
        <p>Today, Chrome still rules desktop browsers while Safari owns the mobile browsing market. However,
          there
          still
          is no defined winner. The browser wars are still going strong and fragmentation is a more prevalent
          issue
          than ever due to the frequent updates and releases of different browser versions and operating systems.
          Browsers preferences are also largely dependant on demographics including age, country, and even job.
          For
          example, many schools and companies have certain requirements about what devices, operating systems,
          and
          browsers users may access and don’t permit individuals to update on their own.</p>
        <p>Additionally, as browsers continually update versions hoping to be the next Google Chrome, there’s no
          saying
          when one will finally surpass its popularity or when another company creates their own browser to enter
          the
          mix. In fact, with Firefox’s recent Quantum version, more and more users and considering making the
          switch in
          favor of a faster browsing experience.</p>
        <p>Not to mention, the underdog browsers still capture a distinct user base. While something like UC
          Browser
          might not capture a large percentage of the internet in comparison to the big five, it still serves
          about 500
          million people.</p>
